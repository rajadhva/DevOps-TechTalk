# Description
FindBugs is an open source tool for static code analysis of java programs. It scans the compiled bytecode in the compiled class files to identify common bug patterns. The software is distributed as a stand alone GUI application , along with plugins that are available for Eclipse , IntelliJ, Netbeans and other IDE's. 

Static analysis is a method of program debugging that is done by examining the code without executing it. Since static analysis scans the entire code base, it has high probabilities of finding vulnerabilities in remote parts fo the application. Also you can define project specific rules that are expected to be followed. Another major advantage is that this technique helps find bugs early in the development cycle.
